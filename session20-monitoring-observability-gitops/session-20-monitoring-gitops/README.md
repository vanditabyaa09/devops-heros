## Deliverables

| Deliverable | Location |
|---|---|
| Monitoring demo | `01-monitoring/` (compose file, app, Prometheus config, alerts, Grafana dashboard) |
| Observability documentation | `02-observability/README.md` |
| GitOps demo | `03-gitops/` (manifests and the Argo CD Application) |
| Screenshots | `01-monitoring/screenshots/` and `03-gitops/screenshots/` |
| README.md | This file and one in each folder |

## Quick start

```bash
# Task 1: monitoring demo
cd session-20-monitoring-gitops/01-monitoring
docker compose up -d --build
./load.sh normal 60
# Prometheus http://localhost:9090   Grafana http://localhost:3000 (admin / admin)
docker compose down -v
```

GitOps needs the manifests pushed to GitHub first. See [03-gitops](03-gitops/README.md).
